# The Lala List
A list of companies one would not want to touch with a 10ft pole while wearing a Hazmat suit. PRs for new additions are welcome. The list itself is in no particular order.

## Code of Conduct 
- In order to add a company, please Send a PR with company name and public proof of notoriety. 
- Personal grudges, word-of-mouth, arbitrary defamation, and second-hand knowledge would not be considered as enough proof. 
- Proof to be shared in form of screenshots, tweets, archive.is links - anything that is/was a public comment from the company management and is viewable publicly (without logging-in/paywalls). 
- Please do not send screenshots of private conversations and email chains of people simply disgruntled by work or interview processes.

## [Socialcops](https://socialcops.com/)

Unapologetic about exploiting their employees. Convince employees it's okay because "Barack Obama works like this".

> Last I checked, it was 3:07 am. I’ve been working since 11 am yesterday, and I’ll likely be in the office until 6 am when I’ll walk home, fall asleep for a few hours, and come back to do it all over again.

> In a company survey, we learned that SocialCops employees pull an average of 5 all-nighters per month and work about 60 hours per week. Our office is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and someone is usually working in the office at any given time, be it a Sunday afternoon or Friday evening.

> Deepu often comes to work at 4 pm and leaves around 5 am. Krishna, another engineer, loves working in long continuous stretches — several days straight spent in the office alternating coding and Xbox — followed by a full day at home
